# URL Shortener

This is a simple URL shortener tool that allows you to shorten long URLs into shorter ones. It also provides a feature to copy the shortened URL to the clipboard with a single click.

## How it Works

The URL shortener tool uses the TinyURL API to shorten URLs. It takes a long URL as input, sends a request to the TinyURL API, and retrieves the shortened URL. The shortened URL is then displayed to the user along with a "Copy to Clipboard" button. Clicking on the button copies the shortened URL to the clipboard, making it easy to share or use elsewhere.
